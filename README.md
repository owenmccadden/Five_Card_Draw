# Five_Card_Draw
This project is a console-based game of Five-Card Draw Poker. I am in the process of developing a GUI for the poker game.

## Summary

The program is made up of interfaces and classes to represent a card, a deck of cards, a poker hand, a player, a poker game, and a main class to run the game.
Running the main class will initiate a console-based poker game between the player and the computer. The computer always matches the bets placed by the player. The game will continue until one player wins all the chips available.
